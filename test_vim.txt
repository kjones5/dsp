I am typing my first line
I have to input line breaks using "enter" while in insert mode

Here is a fourth line, but only the third with text
I can hit "escape" to go back to command mode

Command mode lets me move around the file once I have put content in it
And probably do some coll stuff like copying/pasting

I have to be in command mode to save my file
